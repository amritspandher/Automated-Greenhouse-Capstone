Our automated greenhouse system will present full monitoring capabilities of the environmental parameters of the user’s greenhouse. Our system will allow monitoring to be done remotely through the use of our web-based mobile application. Sensors will be installed in the user’s greenhouse which will read and record environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc. Using this data our application will provide data visualizations for the user to better digest the data and view in a visually pleasing way. The system will also allow for remote control over some modules installed as well, such as lights, fans, irrigation, etc. Users will be able to remotely activate or deactivate these modules and also will be able to set scheduled times for them to be on or off. The user will be able to set certain target parameters for the environment, and when those conditions reach outside of the target zone the system will alert the user that attention is required. The user will register and login with a unique username and allow guest account users to view their greenhouses and will be able to allow limited access to their guests. Our system also allows the user to keep track of their greenhouse by takiing photos of the interior and uploading pictures to our Firebase cloud storage, then the app can grab the images and display for the user.
